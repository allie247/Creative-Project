My inspiration for the layout of this project was a personal goal of mine, to feel more confident in my computer programming abilities and revisit the types of projects that made me so interested in computer science in the first place. I am a computer science major as well as a classical civilization major, and this semester I enrolled in my first couple of advanced-level CS courses. I have found that some of these courses are more focused on algorithms and math rather than crafting personal or group programming projects, which is what sparked my interest as I worked through my introduction-level courses. This shift in material has caused me to feel fairly disconnected with and uninterested in my field of study, and I have been striving to rediscover the passion that I once had for computer science. I also found that my two majors have never really interacted with each other during my time at UVM, and I have been wanting to craft some type of project that would allow the skills that I have learnt in both fields to work alongside each other. I think this project, a relatively simple computer program that demonstrates what I have learned in my classical civilization studies, is a solid approach that will help me to achieve my goals. The inspiration for the topic of this project, how the expectation to assert dominance and control over women impacted the way men interacted with their wives and mistresses in outrageous ways, was induced as a result of my interest in reading Ovid’s Ars Amatoria and Richlin’s article, “Pliny’s brassiere”, and I wanted to engage with that material more.
